# Previews

We provide previews grouped by geometry type here:

* [Point patches](https://github.com/kartoza/QGIS-Legend-Patches/blob/master/point-patches.md)
* [Line patches](https://github.com/kartoza/QGIS-Legend-Patches/blob/master/line-patches.md)
* [Polygon patches](https://github.com/kartoza/QGIS-Legend-Patches/blob/master/polygon-patches.md)

The individual geometries are also provided in case you want to hand craft some yourself.

# Collections

You can import these patches directly into QGIS. We have split the patches into collections or you can 
take the 'all-patches.xml' if you just want everything in one go.

Name | Author | File
-----|--------|-------
All  | Various | all-patch-shapes.xml
Italy Provinces | Tot√≤ Fiandaca | Italian-regions.xml
Klas Patches | Klas Karlsson | klas-karlsson-patches.xml
Archaeology Patches | Val Pinna | Archaeological_patches.xml
Peru Departaments | Antony Barja | Peru_regions.xml

Once you have downloaded a patch file, import it in QGIS as per the screenshots below:

## What is this all about?

See this video which explains what legend patches are in QGIS:

## How to contribute

Please submit a PR request updating any of the patch listings here. Please also provide an XML export of your styles in a collection file and update this readme to include a collection entry for your work. If we get enough nice looking ones I may submit them as an upstream patch to QGIS.org so they become defaults in QGIS.
